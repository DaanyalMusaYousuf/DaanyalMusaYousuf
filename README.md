- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaanyalMusaYousuf and im 18 years old living in London, England
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, working with others, logical problem solving and im also interested in certain hobbies such as football, gaming and anything sports-related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mathematics at a BSC degree level at Queen Mary University and I am currently doing a python module that has allowed me to understand coding at a deeper level in a matter of a few weeks. For example understanding the concepts of logic, loops, list comprehensions and functions swiftly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a software that looks to help others or create a game that allows students to destress after studying.
