- 👋 Hi, I’m @DaanyalMusaYousuf and im 18 years old living in London, England. I go to Queen Mary University and study Mathematics at BSC degree level.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, working with others, logical problem solving and im also interested in certain hobbies such as football, gaming, anything sports-related, entertainment, influencing and social media in general. However, im still keen on how mathematics makes you think analytically and logically. Im also intruiged in how python coding can also be expressed mathematically. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mathematics at a BSC degree level at Queen Mary University and I am currently doing a python module that has allowed me to understand coding at a deeper level in a matter of a few weeks. For example understanding the concepts of logic, loops, list comprehensions and functions swiftly. Im also doing other modules such as number sets & functions, analysis with calculus and probability & statistics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a software that looks to help others or create a game that allows students to destress after studying. I may also colloborate with others to make a group and use social media to promote my software, games or even products sometime in the future.
